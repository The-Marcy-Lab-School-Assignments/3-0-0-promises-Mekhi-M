# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

`Outisde promise` will print first. Then `Inside promise` will print. The reason for this is that synchronous code will run in order before any asynchronous code you have. Since `Inside promise` is inside the promise it is asynchronous code and as such it will run after the `Outside promise` code that is not inside of an asynchronous structure.
